# 🅿️ Smart Parking Detection System – AI-Powered Parking Occupancy Predictor

A deep learning-based **Smart Parking System** built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and the PKLot dataset. This project detects whether a parking space is **occupied** or **empty** using image classification powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

> ⚠️ *This is a demo/portfolio project created for learning and academic purposes. Dataset credits belong to UFPR's PKLot project.*


## 🔍 Key Features

✅ Uses real-world parking lot images from the PKLot dataset  
✅ Binary image classification using a CNN model  
✅ Image preprocessing, normalization, and augmentation  
✅ Evaluation with confusion matrix and test accuracy  
✅ Clean and modular code via Jupyter Notebook  
✅ Future-ready for real-time camera input integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Jupyter Notebook
* pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samdisha-walia/Smart-Parking.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd smart-parking-system

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Unix
venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook parking-lot-prediction.ipynb
```

## 📊 Model Workflow

### 🧹 Preprocessing

* Load images from `PKLotSegmented`
* Resize images (typically to 54×32 or similar)
* Normalize pixel values
* Split into train/test sets

### 🧠 Model Architecture

* 3 Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
* Dense layers with Dropout
* Sigmoid output for binary classification

### 📈 Evaluation

* Accuracy, precision, recall
* Confusion matrix
* Visual prediction examples
